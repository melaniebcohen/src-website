        <p>I have been working as a psychologist since 1984 in my office near the Pike Place Market. I have a PhD in Counseling Psychology from the University of Washington, an MS in Education from the University of Pennsylvania, and a BA from Grinnell College.</p>
        
        <p>My early work experience in Seattle was with Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest, and that generated long-term interests in sexuality, female health issues, and counseling. Iâ€™ve also done some specialized work with people with physical and sensory disabilities. I work with couples in many configurations: straight, gay, lesbian, living together, married, separating and divorcing.</p>
          
        <p>As a member of the <a href='http://www.apa.org/' target='_blank'>American Psychological Association</a> and the <a href='http://www.wapsych.org/' target='_blank'>Washington State Psychological Association</a>, my practice is governed by a code of ethical responsibility. This means that I provide the best service that I am capable of providing and work within the limits of my competencies.</p>

        <p>In the last decade, I have been drawn to a newer therapeutic approach called Emotionally Focused Therapy, developed by Dr. Sue Johnson. <span>I am enthusiastic about this evidence-based, systematic approach to couple and individual issues, rooted in attachment theory.</span></p>
        
        <p>I am active in the therapy process and work cooperatively with clients to establish goals. In addition to Emotionally Focused Therapy, I have some training in the theoretical approaches of John Gottman, David Schnarch, and the PREP approach to communication skills. <span>I will be working from 8:15-4:15 Mondays & Tuesdays, and 8:30-12:30 on Wednesdays. I am not a preferred provider on any insurance panels.</span> I enjoy the work that I do.</p>
